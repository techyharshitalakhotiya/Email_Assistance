/email-assistant-frontend/: The Vite + React frontend for the Chrome Extension.

 Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Java (JDK) 21

Apache Maven

Node.js (LTS version)

A Google Gemini API Key

1. Backend Setup
First, get the server running.

Navigate to the Backend Directory:

cd Email-Assistance

Configure API Key:

Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file.

Find the line gemini.api.key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE.

Replace the placeholder with your actual Gemini API key.

Run the Application:

Open the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code).

Run the EmailAssistanceApplication.java file.

The backend will start and listen on http://localhost:8080.

2. Frontend Setup
Next, set up the Chrome Extension UI.

Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

cd ../email-assistant-frontend

Install Dependencies:

npm install

Build the Extension:

This command compiles the React code into static files Chrome can use.

npm run build

This will create a dist folder. This folder is your complete extension.

Loading the Extension in Chrome
Open your Google Chrome browser.

Go to chrome://extensions.

Enable "Developer mode" with the toggle in the top-right corner.

Click the "Load unpacked" button.

Select the dist folder that was created inside your email-assistant-frontend project.

The "Smart Email Assistant" icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar! (You may need to pin it from the puzzle-piece menu).

How to Use
Make sure the backend is running!

Popup Assistant: Click the extension icon in your toolbar to open the main UI.

Gmail Integration:

Open Gmail.

Click the "Compose" button.

You will see a new "Assistant" button next to the "Send" button.

 Future Enhancements
This project has a solid foundation. Here are some ideas for future development:

Direct Text Insertion: Make the Gmail button read the text from the compose box and insert the generated text back automatically.

Generation History: Save past generations to a database so users can access them later.

User Accounts: Implement authentication to keep user histories private.
